            <p>More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
              unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
              mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and,
              to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at
              first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur
              a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third.
              It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on
              these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward
              pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn
              back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give
              herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck
              her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some
              odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford,
              her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s
              happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly
              understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came
              into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed
              to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts?
              She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to
              what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and
              she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite
              the Parsonage.</p>
